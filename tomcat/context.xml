      Stop on failed deployments:
        - Set "force" to just perform a "System.exit" of the server JVM
        - Otherwise enable call to shutdown port, optionally
          - set port (default: 8005) and shutdown password (default: SHUTDOWN) as in server.xml
          - set waitForStart (default 30) to make the shut down command wait until TC is completely up and running
